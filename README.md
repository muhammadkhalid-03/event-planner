### Setup Google Maps API

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the following APIs:
   - Maps JavaScript API
   - Street View Static API
   - Geocoding API
   - **Places API** (for advanced place search functionality)
4. Create credentials (API key)
5. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your API key:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

**Important:** After creating/updating the `.env.local` file, restart your development server with `npm run dev` for the environment variables to take effect.

### Recent Updates & Fixes
